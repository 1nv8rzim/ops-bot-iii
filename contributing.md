## Running OBIII for the First Time

To run OBIII for the first time, please refer to the README file in the repository. It provides detailed instructions on setting up the necessary configurations and dependencies.

## Modular Structure

OBIII follows a modular structure and handles three types of events: `slash`, `handlers`, and `scheduled`. These events correspond to different ways a function can be triggered within the bot.

To contribute to the functionality of OBIII, you can create or modify the following:

### Slash Commands

- Create a new file under `commands/slash/` to define a new slash command.
- Use the provided template and follow the coding guidelines when creating the command.

### Handlers

- Create a new file under `commands/handlers/` to define a new event handler.
- Handlers execute based on specific actions and can respond to events like user joins, messages being sent, deleted, or edited, and more.

### Scheduled Events

- Create a new file under `commands/scheduled/` to define a new scheduled event.
- Scheduled events run once when the bot starts and can be used for tasks that need to be managed on their own.

Please ensure that your contributions follow the coding guidelines and provide meaningful documentation where necessary.
